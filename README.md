# Set - Programmeren in de Wiskunde - Quinn Leppers, Nola Vos, Niki Manders
# Manual
# The first step for the code to be used is to have python3 installed. A tutorial on how
# to install Python can be found here. There are currently two ways to play the game,
# one which will run in the terminal command line without visualization, and one
# where we have implemented visualization. It is required to install pygame if you want
# to play the visual version of the game. Information on how to install pygame can be
# found here.
# Terminal game
# To play the terminal version all you have to do is download a ZIP of the main branch,
# unzip it, and run the game file in the terminal. After running the file, the user is asked to
# input a SET, this should be done in the form 1,2,3 with cards chosen from the table.
# After inputting 3 numbers, the program will check if the given three cards form a set.
# If they do the player gets a point, otherwise the computer gets a point. The game ends
# by pressing ctrl+c or when there are no more cards left in the deck. While playing the
# game the player is shown 12 numbered cards and the amount of cards left in the deck.
# Visual game
# To play the visual version you have to download the repository and run the visual file
# instead of the game file. However, you will need to change the path in lines 19 and 45.
# Change the name of ’Eindproject Wiskunde’ to the name of the map you have the file
# in, and it should work. Please give input in the form a, b, c, as otherwise nothing
# will happen.
