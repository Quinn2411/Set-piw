# Plan van aanpak
# STEP 1 = CLASS: make a class of cards that supports at least property comparison -> represent cards as a list
# STEP 2 = CHECK: write an algorithm that checks if a given collection of 3 cards (given by the user) is indeed a set (use property comparison)
# STEP 3 = FINDALLSETS: write an algorithm to find all sets from a given collection of 12 cards (so: find all sets on the table)
# STEP 4 = FINDONESET: write an algorithm that finds one set, thus write an algorithm that takes one set from the list we obtained by step 3, and present it to the player (once the player has run out of time)
# STEP 5 = VISUALISATION
